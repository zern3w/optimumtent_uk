				<h3 >How to pick out a single <?php echo $uc_type ;?> tent?</h3>
				<p>
					<blockquote>
						It is not simple to find the right Coleman tent for yourself, particularly when there are <?php echo $TotalTents ; ?> to choose from.
						To make things a lot simpler I decided it best to divide them up into more manageable groups. With prices ranging from $<?php echo $LowestPrice ;?> up to $<?php echo $HighestPrice ; ?> and sizes ranging from <?php echo $Smallest ; ?> sq ft up to <?php echo $Largest ; ?> sq ft.
						I figured it best to create 5 different sections where you can compare like with like. Start by picking one of the sections below that best suits you below. At the bottom of the page you can find a list of the top ten.
						<br /><br />
						<strong>TLDR To busy to read through each section?</strong> Jump straight to the <a href="#top-ten-<?php echo $lc_type ; ?>-tents">Top 10 <?php echo ' '.$uc_type.' ' ?>Tents</a>

					<br />
						The one with the best overall score is Coleman's <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#sundome-2">Sundome 2</a>
						The top five positions are dominated by three of Coleman's extremely popular Sundome model. The <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#sundome-3">3 person version</a> sits in the second place and the larger 4 person model is to be found in fourth place.
						<strong>All three can be purchased for around $50 the difference in price between the three is next to nothing.</strong> With this in mind, and assuming you are not considering purchasing it based on their weights, the <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#sundome-4">Sundome 4</a> <i>"pictured below"</i> is always going to be the best buy with near double the sleeping area of the smallest, for just a few extra few dollars it makes a great deal compared to the smaller versions.

							Slipping into third place is Coleman's original <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#instant-4">4 person Instant Tent</a> Even now after the introduction of many more Instant tents in all shapes and sizes over the last few years, it continues to beat out the competition and newer versions. <strong>It is a little small for four people with only 56 sq ft compared to the Sundome 4, which has 100 sq ft</strong> Personally I am not a fan of the whole Instant Tent craze, half the space for double the price just does not add up, if it is just to save ten minutes setting up a tent a few times a year. That been said campers love this tent and the larger versions, and seem quite happy to pay extra for the convenience it offers. The larger <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#instant-6">6 person version</a> is better suited to families of four. It also has great ratings. <i>Both are sold without a rain fly, which you will need to purchase.</i>

						<p>
							Rounding out the top five is the <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#hampton-6">Hampton 6</a> <i>"pictured below"</i> This cabin tent is one of Coleman's most recent additions. It has been received well and has quickly started to get a good reputation for been easy to setup and spacious, the hinged door is another extra people really appreciate. Size wise it is not a huge 6 person tent with only 90 sq ft It does though have lots of headroom, It considerably smaller than the Big Horn 6 which has 150 sq ft and is largest of all the <a href="/6-person-tents.php#largest">6 person tents</a> The Hampton 6 is probably best suited to groups of four planning on camping for a few weeks at a time wanting a couple of rooms and a little extra space. Even though it is the most expensive of all the Coleman Tents at its current price of $<?php echo $AmazonPriceB00ZG3HHWK.$spd ; ?> it is a lot cheaper than many other 6 person tents.

						In this section you will find a number of tents that are what could call <i>"well rounded"</i> generally speaking they have better than average ratings, most are what you would call mid sized. One thing they all have in common is a low price per square foot compared to other Coleman tents. <strong>The average price per square foot of all the Coleman tents is just $<?php echo round($AveragePricePerSqFoot,2).$gpd ; ?></strong> <i>"significantly less than other brands"</i> all the tents below fall right around or under that average price per sq ft, they are not huge or the cheapest of all the Coleman tents.

						One of the older models the <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#evanston-8">Evanston 8</a> offers outstanding value. <strong>Like most all tents the suggested number of people it can accommodate is overstated by the manufacture.</strong> With 144 sq ft it would be tight for eight, six would be comfortable. It is a great tent that was introduced many years ago and continues to sell well, even after many years. With a decent porch area it offers a lot of space for only $<?php echo $AmazonPriceB001RPH7JY.$spd ; ?> For just a little extra the newer <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#evanston-screened-8">Evanston 8 Screened</a> is well worth considering and is hugely popular.

						Slowly but surely Coleman appears to be phasing out its Elite version of some models, differing in color to the standard versions they are easy to spot, as they are all colored navy blue and white compared to the standard green and white colors used for many years on the old Coleman favorites. Both the <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#elite-sundome-6">Elite Sundome 6</a> and Montana 8 offer great value at their currently discounted prices.

						<strong>After the Instant tent came the Fast Pitch tent both terms created by Coleman</strong> the <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#echo-lake-8-fast-pitch-with-cabinet">Echo Lake Fast Pitch 8 with Cabinet</a> is a good looking tent and one that drops into more than one section on this page. With not a lot of reviews and a mixture of ratings the jury is still out on this one. On the price and size fronts it scores well and incorporates extra storage space in the form of two cabinets <i>"that you can see below"</i> At its current price of $<?php echo $AmazonPriceB00S57N68S.$spd ; ?> It looks like a better choice would be the trusted <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#weathermaster">Weathermaster 10</a> that has been around forever and is loved by thousands of campers.

						Smaller by just a single foot is the all new Octagon 98 as suggested it has eight sides. It is spacious with 169 sq ft and has a lot more headroom than the Red Canyon 8  not only at the center but also through out the interior.
						The included steel poles make for a strong and sturdy tent able to take a beating in storms. With two large zippered doors and two windows nobody is complaining about ventilation. It is a heavy tent weighing in at around 40lbs
						It is possible to set it up on your own, two is better though. A half fly is included and appears by all accounts to be doing a great job at keeping the rain out, with no reports of leaks.
						<strong>All in all the Octagon 98 appears to be a slightly better quality tent than the Red Canyon 8 needless to say it does cost a little more. Is the extra $100 worth it? If you are taking long trips at the beginning and end of the 3 seasons probably yes. It will keep you warmer and provide more protection in the spring and fall.</strong>

						The Echo Lake Fast Pitch 8 with Cabinet is another of Coleman's newer models with 160 sq ft and 7' of headroom it is large, the thing is at the moment there is some doubt as to the actual size, some folk have mentioned the size quoted by Coleman includes the depth of the cabinets, if this is correct it is only 128 sq ft It also has not started out life with great ratings.

						When Coleman introduced their first Instant Tent to the world back in 2013 I was a little skeptical it was smaller than similar tents and quite a lot more money. The original <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#instant-8">Instant 8</a> has over the years has become an all time favorite along with the more recent Instant Cabin both have huge followings with great ratings. Costing a little over $200 the Instant 8 has 140 sq ft of sleeping area along with 6' 5" of headroom. Setup is quick and easy as the name suggests it is also available in smaller the sizes. The <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#instant-6">Instant 6</a> also falls into this best selling group, it is quite a lot smaller and only a little cheaper <strong>making the larger 8 person version a better buy.</strong> If your looking for a large dependable, easy to setup tent Coleman's Original Instant 8 tent <i>"pictured below"</i> looks like a good choice.

						<strong>The Sundome 4 introduced back in 2011</strong> continues to offer outstanding value. <strong>More than 70% of buyers give it 5 star ratings.</strong> It is a small dependable tent that only costs around $50 less than a couple of night in a cheap motel. All of the Sundome tents score well of the three smaller ones this <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#sundome-4">4 person version</a> is easily the best offering a decent amount of space for a couple. A lot of the more recent additions are all modeled after the Sundome none offer anything near the value this one does. Ideal for couples even those with a small child at the current price of $<?php echo $AmazonPriceB004J2GUOU.$spd ; ?> it is one of the safest choices on the market today.

						The <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#montana-8">Montana 8</a> is another of one of Coleman's Classic models that have stood the test of time. It is has got into this section mainly because of the length of time it has been around, "since 2009" With its hinged door and covered entry and it's current price of $<?php echo $AmazonPriceB001TSCF96.$spd ; ?> it is a nice tent for smaller families that want an affordable tent that is not going to let them down.

						Of all the recently introduced models only the <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#tenaya-lake-fast-pitch-8">Tenaya Lake Fast Pitch 8</a> seems to have hit the ground running. One of the pricier Coleman tents currently $<?php echo $AmazonPriceB00TFY8Z54.$spd ; ?> has got good reviews from day one. With 6' 8" of headroom and 121 sq ft it's a decent sized tent advertised as "fast pitch" somewhere between the Instant Tents and the older more classic designs.

					<blockquote>
						Introduced quite recently the Coleman <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#coleman-pop-up-4">Pop Up 4</a> is another tent with a decent following. It is <strong>Ideal for those looking for a cheap and easy introduction to camping,</strong> solo campers could opt for the smaller <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#coleman-pop-up-2">Pop Up 2</a> Both are priced under $100
					</blockquote>
					<br />
						Both the Evanston Screened tents are hugely popular. <strong>The smaller <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#evanston-screened-6">6 person tent</a> has been one of the best selling tents on this website for the last two years.</strong> Offering a decent amount of space and a screened porch area to keep the bugs out. The <a href="/coleman-family-tents-comparison-guide.php#evanston-screened-8">8 person version</a> is not a lot bigger, considering the extra it costs the Red Canyon above looks to be better value if you want something bigger.
