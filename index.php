							<h3>Choosing a Tent</h3>
								<p>
									Your new tent is going to accommodate a number of people sleeping in a relatively small space. Square footage and ventilation should be considered first and foremost. If you are going to use it regularly, it's always better to opt on the side of quality and spend as much as your budget will allow for, just like any other purchase. <strong>First time camping?</strong> Try and borrow one from a friend or buy a used one to see if camping is going to work for you and your family.
									Your local Craigslist is a great place to start looking for a used tent, this way you can pick it up in person and inspect it before purchasing it.
									For a more in-depth view on how to choose a tent, check out this <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Choose-a-Tent">Wikihow</a>
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									<strong>The size of the tent should be your number one consideration!</strong>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									How many people and how much gear will you be traveling with is a good place to start, the simplest way to calculate a good sized tent for your family is, double the number of persons traveling. For example, if you have two adults and two children consider an 8 person tent. Larger groups and parents with very young children can probably use a multiple of 1.5 and still have a decent amount of space. <br /><br />The length of your holiday and the frequency of your trips should also be considered, the longer the time span the more space you will likely need. Finding a spot to set up a very large  tent can be more difficult, heating and keeping it warm inside is also another issue to consider, bigger tents can be less stable in windy conditions, unless guy lines are used. More space still tends to trump these more minor considerations though. Tents that are tall enough to stand up inside are a big plus. The weight of family size camping tents should not be a problem if the tent is just been carried to and from the car.

										The dome is the most popular design for general camping. It is stable and simple to assemble, using two or three poles through the center of the roof. The ground area is normally a large square or hexagonal floor plan. Dome tents generally provide decent headroom.
										Separate room dome tents larger in size, and often called <a href="/modified-dome-tents.php">modified dome tents</a> are also available. The extra porch area that many have can be used to store equipment and is very handy. Using a square floor plan uses space in the most efficient way. Hexagonal tents use a three-pole system, which increases the stability, providing less inside space.

										If the weight of the tent is of importance to you a tunnel tent may be the option, as they are normally lighter than most other family sized tents.

										Rarely designed for more than 3-4 persons, they get a mention because they are some of the smallest and lightest tents on the market, they make an ideal choice for small families backpacking. The shape offers adequate floor space considering its smaller size. Curved poles create a shape that the name implies. Most have roomy interiors and doors. Snow "if you are into winter camping" and rain flows easily off this type of tent, making them great "four season tents."

									It is nearly impossible to pull into a camping site and not see a tent made by <a href="http://www.coleman.com/coleman-tentsandshelters//">Coleman</a> No coincidence since they are one of the most popular brands on the market today. Having started back in 1946, they have a huge selection of tents available in different sizes and styles. When it comes to value for money, one of my favorites is a modified dome tent, called the Montana.
